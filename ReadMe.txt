This is auxiliary software for the UCLA Phonotactic Learner, a java program accessible at http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/Phonotactics/index.htm.  This program is simply a utility meant to make the output file a little easier for linguists to read.

Windows only, sorry.

I suggest you download the .exe file, and put it in whatever output folder you are using for the UCLA Phonotactic Learner.  Click to run.

I did include the source code, which is in Microsoft Visual Basic 6, a language long ago abolished by Microsoft. You can read the files simply as text to see what I did to write it.
